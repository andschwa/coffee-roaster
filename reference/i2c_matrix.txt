From Dr. Robert Rinker:

To make your life easier, setup the unit as I2C.

Then it’s a matter of first initializing display (turning it on,
clearing, cursor underline on or off, setting contrast, setting
backlight) and then moving cursor to location for placing
character. Note the execution time for each command which may require
a delay before sending the next command. For example, displaying
changing data (like temperature), you can employ the 0x49 and 0x4A
commands instead of the Set cursor command. Ex: ‘A’ = b01000001 = 0x41
= 65 = standard ASCII code for the letter
‘A’. http://web.cs.mun.ca/~michael/c/ascii-table.html
 
Cursor locations: Top left = 0x00 = 0, top-right = 0x13 = 19 (20
spaces horizontally) Bottom-left = 0x54 = b01010100 = 84, bottom-right
= 0x67 = b01100111 = 103 Be careful since the positions are not linear
from top to bottom.
 
The gist of the matter: send command and then parameter if
required. The display is using a PIC microcontroller (similar to the
Atmel on the Arduino), which just sits there waiting for incoming data
to tell it how to drive the display.
